# PhoneBuzz (LendUp Challenge)
------------------------------

### Requirements: 

- Node.js 
- NPM
- Redis

### Installation

- Clone this repository onto a server
- Start Redis
- Run `npm install`
- Rename the `.envCopy` file as `.env` and edit variables appropriately
- Point Twilio's call webhook to `http://YOURURL.com/twilio/start`
- Run `npm start`

### Demo

I have completed all four parts as one large project. I had some spare Twilio credits, so you can test this directly (no need to whitelist the phone number)!

**Phases 1 + 2** can be tested by dialing `(240) 724 8883` (my Twilio number). 

**Phases 3 + 4** can be tested by visiting http://phonebuzz.thupukari.com. 

Thanks!
